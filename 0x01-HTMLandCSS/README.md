<h2>WHAT IS CSS?</h2>
<p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language that allows you to adjust the design and feel of your HTML content.
Thus, you can turn your pure-HTML pages into stunning, modern websites with CSS. And itâ€™s super easy to learn, too</p>
<p>CSS allows you to target individual HTML elements and apply different styling rules to them.</p>
